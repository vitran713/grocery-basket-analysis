This Jupyter notebook is focused on conducting market basket analysis, a data mining technique used to discover purchase patterns by identifying relationships between items purchased together frequently. Here's how I've structured the code and the analyses conducted:

Library Imports and Initial Setup: I start by importing necessary libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, mlxtend for market basket analysis, numpy and matplotlib for numerical operations and plotting, seaborn for enhanced visualizations, and sklearn for clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).
Data Loading and Preparation: The data, stored in a CSV file named 'Groceries_dataset.csv', is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. I sort this data by the 'Date' column and set it as the index to prepare for further analysis.
Data Encoding and Transformation: I perform one-hot encoding on the 'itemDescription' column to transform categorical item descriptions into a format suitable for market basket analysis. This involves converting item descriptions into binary (0/1) columns for each item, where 1 indicates the presence of an item in a transaction, and 0 indicates its absence.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I calculate and display the total number of unique members (customers) represented in the dataset. Additionally, I group the data by 'Member_number' and 'Date' to summarize purchases per customer per visit, facilitating a deeper understanding of customer shopping patterns.
Visualization of Shopping Behavior: Using matplotlib, I plot the number of visits for the top 10 members who shop the most frequently. This visualization helps in identifying key customers and analyzing their shopping habits.
Advanced Data Analysis: Through using libraries such as kmeans and CPA, I also performed clustering to segment customers and reduced dimensionality for more efficient analysis
